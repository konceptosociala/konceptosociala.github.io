title = "Website and theme update"

After quite some time spent searching for an acceptable color palette for the website, I ended up choosing a nice dark theme.

So for now the homepage look like this:

<img src="/img/blog/2023-07-10-website-update/screen1.jpg" class="img-dashed">

I also had to add several new components to the theme, such as **project blocks** and **information blocks**, which are now available as [Zola shortcodes](https://konceptosociala.eu.org/socio/blog/shortcodes/).

Comments feature will be added soon (with `utterances`). In the meantime [download the Socio theme](https://konceptosociala.eu.org/socio) and use it for your portfolio!
